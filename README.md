# FoodScraper

This is a Python web app using Selenium and Flask to scrape and display menu and nutritional data from the Carolina Dining Services [website](dining.unc.edu). 

Required dependencies can be installed with 
 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Selenium also requires chromedriver, which can be found [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

For the forseeable future, a live version of this application can be accessed at `152.23.17.219` if you are connected to UNC Wifi.
